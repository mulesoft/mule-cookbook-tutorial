=== Adding Connection Management

Unlike the *getRecentlyAdded* call that doesn't need for you to be authenticated, all other operations require that you set a token on each request.

The client you are using provides a login call that initializes the token and uses it in subsequent requests.

[NOTE]
====
Take into account that the session can expire and cause the connector to make a login request again.
====

DevKit provides a different set of annotations to keep your code clean and handle the connection in a different class for delegating responsibilities.

To implement @ConnectionManagement, you need to instead of using the @Start annotation as we did before, move the initialization to @ConnectionManagement.

. In the ConnectorConfig change the @Configuration for a @ConnectionManagement annotation

. Add the MuleCookbookClient to the ConnectorConfig and add a getter and getter.

. Implement these four methods as shown in the code sample that follows:
+
* *@Connect* - Initialize the client, and if you don't have a login, call the API to verify.
+

include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=41..50]

* *@Disconnect* - Release any connection if required.

----

* *@ValidateConnection* - Check that your connection is alive.

include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=63..66]
----
+
* *@ConnectionIdentifier* - Return a string value. This will only be used when debugging.

. Remove the MuleCookBookClient from the CookbookConnector and the @Start method
+
. On our @Processor use the client provided by the ConnectorConfig

If you try to run our tests, now we see that the test fails with a SAXParseException because we need to add a username and password to our configuration.

Same will happen if you install this version and try to run the mule app we created before.

Just open the global configuration of your connector and check that there are 2 new fields, username and password. Configure them and you can run the app again.
