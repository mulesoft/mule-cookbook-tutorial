=== Multiple Configuration

If you want to have multiple connection configurations there are two things to take into account:

* All Configurations either need to implement the same interface or have a common parent class.
* The connector Config field needs to be declared either as the interface or as the common parent class.

If your configuration has common fields, they can be defined at a parent class.

In our connector, after the refactor the classes would look like this:

class OAuthConfig {
-String consumerKey
-String consumerSecret
-String accessToken
}
